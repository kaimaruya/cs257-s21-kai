		<h3>Why Loneliness?</h3>

		<p>After the strike of the Covid-19 pendamic, people are forced to quarantine and work from home for months. 
			Some studies <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7306546/">(e.g.)</a> found that social distancing at home had some impact on people's loneliness, 
			and this raised our interest in finding the possible relation between loneliness and other factors.

         <h3>What Are These Plots</h3>
         <p>This website will generate a bar plot showing how people responded to a given question, or if two questions are select will generate a heatmap, where each cell shows 
         the probability of a respondant giving any pair of answers (e.g. yes to feeling lonely and no to feeling happy). This can help to indicate correlation and patterns in responses,
         though with a limited sample size and a wide variety of variables this should of course be taken with a grain of salt.
