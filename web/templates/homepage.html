		<h2 id="why">Why Loneliness?</h2>

		<p>After the strike of the Covid-19 pendamic, people are forced to quarantine and work from home for months. 
			Some studys <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7306546/">(e.g.)</a> found that social distancing at home had some impact on people's loneliness, 
			and this raised our interest in finding the possible relation between loneliness and other factors.
		</p>

		<h2 id= "about"> What Can We do?</h2>
		<p>This site will allow users to investigate the relationships between loneliness and isolation by generating plots for different variables, 
			other habits and lifestyle choices, and general happiness and contentment, in order to encourage thinking about how these things impact each other and our daily lives.
