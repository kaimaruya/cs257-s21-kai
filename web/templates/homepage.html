		<p>After the strike of the Covid-19 pendamic, people are forced to quarantine and work from home for months. 
			Some studys <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7306546/">(e.g.)</a> found that social distancing at home had some impact on people's loneliness, 
			and this raised our interest in finding the possible relation between loneliness and other factors.
